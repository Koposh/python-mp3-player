python3 mp3 player 

Hello guys, I am a beginner programmer and student of python3 and I create a very basic python3 program that can be simply an mp3 player.

This is a basic program in python 3 that can be your mp3 player, running in an open terminal, consuming little RAM, which can be a great option for old computers.
